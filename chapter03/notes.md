# Programming Principles and Practice Using C++
### Bjarne Stroustrup

## Chapter 3 - Objects, Types and Values
1. Prompt means to ask the user for input.
2. The `>>` or "get from" operator reads a value into a variable.
3. After prompting the user for an integer value you can:
```c++
int number;
cin >> number;
```
4. \n is called the "newline" character and it is like typing in a carriage return.
5. An input is terminated into a string by white space.
6. An integer is also terminated by white space.
7. Like this: `cout << "Hello, " << first_name << "!\n";`
8. An object is some memory that holds a value of a specific type.
9. A literal string is delimited by double quotes. A variable may refer to, or contain, a literal string. `string string_variable = "Literal string";`
10. Strings and chars?
11. A variable is a named object.
12. A char is typically a single byte, an int is 4 bytes and a double is 8 bytes.
13. We use bytes which are 8 bits.
14. The `=` is an assignment operator and the `==` is used to compare.
15.
